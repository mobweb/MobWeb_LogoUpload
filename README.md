# MobWeb_LogoUpload extension for Magento

A simple extension that adds an upload field for the logo in the Magento Admin Panel, right above the field where the image src can be entered manually. If no image is uploaded, the src from the default field is used instead.

## Installation

Install using [colinmollenhour/modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman/).

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible. If you have a question or are confused about how something is supposed to work, feel free to get in touch and I'll try and help: [info@mobweb.ch](mailto:info@mobweb.ch).
